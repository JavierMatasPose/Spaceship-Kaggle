Contributions are always welcome!

## How to Contribute
1. Fork this repository and clone it on your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer (it should be, but just in case).
3. Create a new branch for your changes. Let's call it something like "fix-spelling-error" or "add-new-feature".
4. Make the necessary code changes in this new branch. Don't forget to add any relevant comments!
5. Upload your test and train CSV files, then run `main.ipynb` - note that this notebook is used for a Kaggle space competition.
6. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. Try to keep it short but descriptive.
7. Push your changes back up to the main repository.
